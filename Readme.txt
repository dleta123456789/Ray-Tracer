Computer Graphics Project 1:
============================

Q. Are you alone or a group? Write your and group member's details:
A.  Your name:      Ans Naveed
    Your roll no:   21-10567
    Member name:    Hamza Muhammad
    Member roll no: 21-10059


Q. Did you enjoy the project?
A. The project was quite enjoyable. Being able to render 3D models by just using some lines of code was a fascinating experience.



Q. If not, why ?
A. N/A



Q. What challenges did you face while doing this project?
A. 
Ans:Starting off the project we had to draw cube using some triangles. Refraction and loading the .obj files in to the project were also the challenges faced during the project.
Hamza: The biggest challange was trying to convert Path Tracing code into Ray Tracing code. 



Q. How much thought (pre-implementation) did you give the project?
A. Our scene was simple enough so we did not give much thought to the project.



Q. How much time did you spend designing your final scene?
A. It took about 10 days to design the final scene



Q. How much time it took to render your final image / video? Your hardware? Any other details if you want to give.
A. It took 1 hour 30 minutes to render our final image. The system on which the image was rendered has following specs:
Ans:
Core i3-8100 CPU
8 GB RAM
AMD RX580 GPU

Hamza:
Intel i7 7700HQ at Clock speed of 2.8Ghz
8GB Ram

Q. Did you do any of the bonus parts?
A. We did refraction, anti aliasing, creating blender model and importing it, 3D transformations.



Q. Was the project easy or tough?
A. The project was a bit towards tough because there were some things that were new so we had to do some reading and then implement them.




Q. Was this course easy or tough?
A. This course was neither easy nor tough.



Q. Do you have any recommendations in order to improve this course? 
A.
Ans: None.
Hamza:The course could improve by teaching students to work with C++ and Path Tracing is used instead of simple Ray Tracing.
In addition, teaching OpenGL/Vulkun or DirectX like Graphic's API instead of Ray tracing could be benifical as going directly into Ray Tracing is harder if students dont have a understanding of how Graphic programming is carried out.

Q. Any wish-list items? Any features that you really wanted to do but we skipped?
A. 
Ans:None.
Hamza:
OpenGL/Vulkun was the only thing which i wanted to learn but was skipped.
